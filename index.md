### Welcome!
I am a PhD student at Department of Economics, Duke University. 

My research interests span **Econometrics**, **Asset Pricing**, and **Machine Learning** topics. Currently, my work mainly focuses on understanding financial markets with high-frequency econometric techniques. Also, as a secondary research agenda, I study machine learning applications in finance, aiming to uncover complex patterns and relationships within financial data.
