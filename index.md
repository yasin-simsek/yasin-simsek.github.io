### Welcome!
I am a PhD student at Department of Economics, Duke University. 

My research interests span Asset Pricing, Econometrics, and Machine Learning topics. Currently, my work mainly focuses on understanding financial markets with high-frequency econometric techniques. Also, as a secondary research agena, I leverage machine learning tools to address questions in asset pricing, uncovering complex patterns and relationships within financial data.

Feel free to reach out to me regarding my research, code etc. My email is [yasin.simsek@duke.edu](mailto:yasin.simsek@duke.edu)
